    shortDescription: >-
      Template scaffold for standardized Docker projects with community health files
      and compliance automation.
    longDescription: >-
      Docker Scaffold is a comprehensive template for releasing projects as Open Source.
      It provides Community Health Files, compliance checklists, linting configurations,
      and automation for code quality assurance.

      Features include:
      - Standardized directory structure following industry best practices
      - Community Health Files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, etc.)
      - Pre-configured linting and code quality tools (MegaLinter v9, Black, Flake8, Pylint)
      - REUSE Software compliance automation for license headers
      - Git workflow automation (Conform for commit message validation)
      - Docker containerization with multi-architecture build support (amd64, arm64)
      - Ansible playbooks for infrastructure and configuration automation
      - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
      - Comprehensive documentation, issue templates, and discussion templates

      This scaffold is designed to be generally usable for any open source project and
      follows well-known conventions and de-facto standards. However, it is intentionally
      opinionated - you are expected to adjust the contents and suggestions to suit your
      specific project needs.

    features:
      - Automated code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
      - REUSE license compliance verification and automation
      - Git commit message validation with Conform
      - Docker multi-architecture build support (amd64, arm64)
      - Community health file templates (issues, discussions, PRs)
      - Ansible playbooks for configuration management
      - Python configuration merging with feature activation
      - Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
      - Pre-configured MegaLinter with 10+ linters
